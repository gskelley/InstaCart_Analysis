# INSTACART ANALYSIS

### OBJECTIVE
Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. While they already have a very good sales, the management team wants to uncover more information about their sales patterns. They are mostly interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products.
